Developed and deployed a serverless application using AWS Lambda,
API Gateway, NodeJS, and DynamoDB Gained hands-on experience with the Serverless
Framework and cloud-native development, focusing on building scalable, efficient, and secure serverless applications
# Utilizing Serverless Framework to deploy application on AWS

Developed and maintained serverless functions for various use cases, optimizing performance and ensuring scalability for high-demand applications.

This does not include any kind of persistence (database).

## Usage

### Deployment

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-http-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-http-api-project-dev (152s)

endpoint: GET - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: aws-node-http-api-project-dev-hello (1.9 kB)
```


### Invocation

After successful deployment, call the created application via HTTP:

```bash
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in response similar to the following (removed `input` content for brevity):

```json
{
  "message": "Go Serverless v2.0! Your function executed successfully!",
  "input": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\",\n  \"input\": \"\"\n}"
}
```
